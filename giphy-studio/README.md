3. Click the topic buttons to add more gifs of that topic.

    - Click the `trash` icon to remove all topics from the sidebar.

### Known Issues
- **Random/Trending:** New gifs are added on each button click. Need to add a 'load more' button inside each of these sections.

- **Search bar query offset**: Searching for a topic that has already been added will not increase the return offset, so the same set of gifs will be added with each search.

- **Saving Favorites**: Favorites are not actually saved anywhere yet. Will implement localStorage later.
